\title{Optical Flow Using Farneback's Algorithm}
\usage{
farneback(
  image1,
  image2,
  pyr_scale = 0.5,
  levels = 3,
  winsize = 43,
  iterations = 3,
  poly_n = 7,
  poly_sigma = 1.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image1}{An \code{\link{Image}} object.}

\item{image2}{An \code{\link{Image}} object.}

\item{pyr_scale}{Parameter, specifying the image scale (<1) to build pyramids
for each image; pyr_scale = 0.5 means a classical pyramid, where each next
layer is twice smaller than the previous one.}

\item{levels}{Number of pyramid layers including the initial image; levels = 1
means that no extra layers are created and only the original images are used.}

\item{winsize}{Averaging window size; larger values increase the algorithm
robustness to image noise and give more chances for fast motion detection,
but yield more blurred motion field.}

\item{iterations}{Number of iterations the algorithm does at each pyramid level.}

\item{poly_n}{Size of the pixel neighborhood used to find polynomial expansion
in each pixel; larger values mean that the image will be approximated with
smoother surfaces, yielding more robust algorithm and more blurred motion
field, typically poly_n = 5 or 7.}

\item{poly_sigma}{Standard deviation of the Gaussian that is used to smooth
derivatives used as a basis for the polynomial expansion; for poly_n = 5, you
can set poly_sigma = 1.1, for poly_n = 7, a good value would be poly_sigma = 1.5.}
}
\value{
A matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the original
 images, and two layers representing the x and y components of the optical
 flow for each pixel of the image.
