\usage{
morph(
  image,
  operation,
  kernel = NULL,
  k_shape = "rectangle",
  k_height = 5,
  k_width = 5,
  iterations = 1,
  in_place = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{An \code{\link{Image}} object.}

\item{operation}{A string corresponding to the name of a morphological
operation to apply to the image (see Note).}

\item{kernel}{A binary matrix. If the matrix is not binary, all positive values
will be automatically converted to 1, all negative values to 0, unless
\code{operation = "hitmiss"} in which case they will be converted to -1.}

\item{k_shape}{A string corresponding to the shape of the kernel for the
morphological operation (see Note; default: "rectangle"). Ignored if a
custom \code{kernel} is provided.}

\item{k_height}{The half-height in pixels of the kernel. Ignored if a custom
\code{kernel} is provided.}

\item{k_width}{The half-width in pixels of the kernel. Ignored if a custom
\code{kernel} is provided.}

\item{iterations}{The number of times the morphological operations should be
applied.}

\item{in_place}{A logical indicating whether the change should be applied to
the image itself (TRUE, faster but destructive) or to a copy of it (FALSE,
the default, slower but non destructive).}
}
\value{
An \code{\link{Image}} object.
}
\description{
\code{morph} applies various morphological operations (see Note)
 to an \code{\link{Image}} object.
}
\note{
There are 8 types of morphological operations that can be achieved with
 this function:
 \itemize{
   \item{"erode":}{for each point, returns the minimum of the points in its
    neighborhood, with that neighborhood defined by the kernel.}
   \item{"dilate":}{for each point, returns the maximum of the points in its
    neighborhood, with that neighborhood defined by the kernel.}
   \item{"open":}{erosion followed by dilation.}
   \item{"close":}{dilation followed by erosion.}
   \item{"gradient":}{difference between the dilation and the erosion of an
    image.}
   \item{"tophat":}{difference between an input image and its opening.}
   \item{"blackhat":}{difference between the closing and its input image.}
   \item{"hitmiss":}{(1) erodes the image with \code{kernel > 0}; (2) erodes
    the complement of the image with \code{kernel < 0}; (3) returns the
    intersection (\code{AND}) of step 1 and step 2. The hit-or-miss transform
    is the basis of more advanced morphological operations such as thinning
    or pruning.}
 }

There are 3 types of predetermined kernel shapes that can be used with
 this function when a custom \code{kernel} is not provided:
 \itemize{
   \item{"rectangle" (the default):}{}
   \item{"cross"}{}
   \item{"ellipse"}{}
 }

balloon <- image(system.file("sample_img/balloon1.png", package = "Rvision"))
